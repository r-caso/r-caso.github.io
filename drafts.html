                <div class="abstract">
                  <p>Marques ("Pejoratives & Oughts," <em>Philosophia</em> 49(3): 2021) argues that Hom's Combinatorial Externalism (CE)
                     faces a hitherto unknown problem when coupled with a standard Kratzerian account of deontic modality: CE plus
                     Kratzerian modality would entail the negation of a thesis central to Hom's analysis of slurs, the 
                     null extensionality thesis (i.e., the thesis that slurs have empty extensions). Since modality is an
                     integral part of Hom's take on slurs, and Kratzer's account of modality has the status of the standard take on modality,
                     this would be bad news for CE. In this paper, I argue that, \emph{pace} Marques, CE and a Kratzerian account of deontic
                     modals do not clash with the null extensionality claim.</p>

                <div class="abstract">
                  <p>McCready (<em>The Semantics and Pragmatics of Honorification</em>, OUP, 2019)
                     proposes a register-based account of honorific expressions. In this account,
                     honorifics are modeled in terms of their conversational effect on register,
                     a contextual parameter capturing the degree of formality of the conversational
                     situation. In this context, honorific pronouns are addressed. Their semantic
                     treatment within McCready's system is not uniform, in that some of them are deemed
                     to semantically encode an honorific level that directly affects the conversational
                     register, whereas others are seen as encoding only general commitments and
                     expectations of the speaker in regard to the registers appropriate in communicative 
                     interaction. In this paper, I propose a uniform account of honorific pronouns,
                     according to which all such expressions lexically encode a register, and I argue 
                     that there are reasons that favor this approach over McCready's own take on the issue.</p>

              <li><strong>A partition-based semantics for deliberative modals</strong>&emsp;<a class="collapsible_abstract">[more]</a>
                <div class="abstract">
                  <p>Deliberative modals (DMs) are deontic modals (like "ought") that order a set of possibilities
                     according to how well they realize the preferences of a deliberative agent. DMs are <em>informational</em>:
                     both what possibilities are relevant and how they are ordered, depend on contextually available information.
                     I propose a modified Kratzerian semantics for DMs, capable of capturing this informational character. A
                     standard Kratzerian account of DMs seems unable to capture how we use DMs in reasoning under uncertainty,
                     for it distinguishes between worlds the agent cannot tell apart. I propose a revised semantics where 
                     the ordering source has a resolution constraint, making for it impossible to distinguish worlds the 
                     agent cannot tell apart. This may be done by relativizing the ordering source to a partition of the modal 
                     base, and by forcing the ordering source to equally rank worlds belonging to the same cell of the partition.
                     The most natural such partition groups worlds according to the action the agent performs at them.</p>

              <li><strong>Deliberative modals are not assessment-sensitive</strong>&emsp;<a class="collapsible_abstract">[more]</a>
                <div class="abstract">
                  <p>MacFarlane and Kolodny ("Ifs and oughts," <em>JPhil</em> 107(3), 2010) and 
                     MacFarlane (<em>Assessment sensitivity</em>, 2014, ch. 11) have argued that 
                     deliberative 'ought' is assessment sensitive, in the sense that its extension is 
                     sensitive to an information state provided by the context of assessment. Their 
                     strategy is two-fold. First, they describe a paradox of deontic modality, the 
                     Miner Paradox, whose resolution, they argue, requires a semantics that 
                     invalidates modus ponens. Second, they posit an assessment-sensitive 
                     semantics that accomplishes precisely that, and they argue that it fares better 
                     than other accounts of deontic modality when faced with the task of explaining 
                     assertion, rejection and retraction data concerning utterances 
                     containing deliberative use of the English deontic quasi-modal 'ought.' In this 
                     paper, I provide an alternative treatment of deliberative 'ought' that does not 
                     involve any deviation from standard context sensitivity, 
                     yet accounts for the data used to motivate assessment sensitivity.</p>

              <li><strong>Is Aesthetic Discourse Assessment-Sensitive? (With Eleonora Orlando)</strong>&emsp;<a class="collapsible_abstract">[more]</a>
                <div class="abstract">
                  <p>The aim of the paper is to evaluate the prospects for an aesthetically informed assessment-sensitive 
                     semantic account of thick aesthetic predicates (TAPs) such as 'balanced,' 'unified,' 'sombre,' and 
                     'shocking.' We distinguish two meaning dimensions concerning TAPs, truth-conditional and expressive,
                     and provide a bidimensional semantics that posits assessment sensitivity at both levels. Then we evaluate
                     the extent to which assessment sensitivity is an apt rendition of aesthetic discourse involving TAPs.
                     We distinguish between experiential TAPs (like 'sombre' and 'shocking') and theoretical TAPs (like 
                     'unified' and 'balanced') and argue that aesthetic disagreement provides evidence for a relativistic 
                     construal both at the truth-conditional and at the expressive level for experiential TAPs, but not for 
                     theoretical TAPs. Thus, an upper bound is found on how much assessment sensitivity may characterize 
                     aesthetic discourse.</p>

              <li><strong>Factual relativism and Truth relativism</strong>&emsp;<a class="collapsible_abstract">[more]</a>
                <div class="abstract">
                  <p>Einheuser (2008) has proposed a metaphysical alternative to truth relativism, which she calls
                     <em>factual relativism</em>. According to this view, it is facts, not truth, that are relative
                     to a perspective. I argue that, despite her efforts, she has not been able to propose an
                     alternative to truth relativism, but a reelaboration thereof. This paper is an exploration into
                     the more metaphysical side of truth relativism, and concludes that Einheuser has provided
                     a possible metaphysical elaboration of what truth relativim might be.</p>

                  <p>Inspired by Einheuser (2008), and by Rovane (<em>The metaphysics and ethics of relativism</em>),
                     I attempt to address the issue of what a metaphysics for truth relativism could be, under the idea
                     that it involves a particular take on how our world (understood as a totality of facts or true
                     propositions) might be. I explore Einheusers multimundialist take on relativism, as well as
                     different ways of articulating unimundial metaphysics for relativism. I attempt to assess to what
                     may amount such a metaphysical debate.</p>

                <div class="abstract">
                  <p>As a followup of the previous idea, I address the prospects for a paraconsistent take on
                     the metaphysics of relativism. According to such a take, the proper metaphysics for truth
                     relativism is a unimundialism that allows for truth value gluts. In a more metaphysical key,
                     it allows for the existence of contradictory facts. In the search for an intuitive foundation
                     for this view, I attempt to identify truth with communitary assertive practices.</p>
